# ARComponent with MindAR and React

Welcome to the ARComponent demo, a marker-based augmented reality (AR) experience built using MindAR with React. Dive into the magic of AR by integrating image tracking with 3D models in your web application.

## Features

- **Marker-Based AR Tracking:** Uses MindAR's image tracking capabilities to detect and interact with markers.
- **3D Model Integration:** Load and display 3D models (e.g., a golden watch) in AR.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Includes ambient and directional lights to enhance the visual experience.
- **Interactive AR Experience:** Feel free to zoom in or out. Once you tap on the 3D model, prepare for some epic sound effects.

## Installation Guide

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ma22-maker/React-MindAR.JS-WatchDemo.git
    cd React-MindAR.JS-WRISTWATCH
    ```

### Install Dependencies

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Start the Development Server

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Marker Image

To test the AR functionality, you will need a marker image. Download the marker image from the following link:

- [Download Marker Image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ma22-maker/ARWatchAssets@main/wp10826527-ben-10-cartoon-wallpapers.jpg)

Print or display this marker image on your screen. Point your deviceâ€™s camera at the marker to see the AR experience come to life.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application:** Open the URL `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

2. **Display the Marker:** Print or display the marker image on a screen.

3. **Interact with AR:** Point your device's camera at the marker image. You should see a 3D model of a golden watch appear in AR.

4. **Enjoy:** Feel free to interact with the AR experience. Zoom in or out to get a better view of the 3D model.

## Pro Tip

For the best experience, open the URL on your mobile device and use it to view the AR content. This allows for a more immersive experience.
